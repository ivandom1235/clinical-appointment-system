| book.php <--> book_handler.php â€” Booking Interaction Documentation
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Overview:
| - This documentation explains the workflow and connection between the
|   patient booking page (book.php) and the backend appointment handler
|   (book_handler.php) in the clinic booking system.
|
| Workflow:
| 1. The authenticated patient visits book.php to book an appointment.
|    - Patient selects a doctor and date.
|    - Available slots are loaded dynamically using JavaScript and slots.php.
|
| 2. For each free slot, book.php renders a mini HTML form with hidden inputs:
|      <form method="POST" action="/backend/book_handler.php">
|        <input type="hidden" name="doctor_id" value="...">
|        <input type="hidden" name="date" value="...">
|        <input type="hidden" name="time" value="...">
|        <button type="submit">[slot time]</button>
|      </form>
|
| 3. When a patient clicks a slot button, the browser sends a POST request to
|    book_handler.php with doctor, date, and time as parameters.
|
| 4. book_handler.php validates the input, checks the session for patient authentication,
|    verifies the patient profile, and attempts to create the booking in the database.
|    - On success, redirects the user to the dashboard with a success message (?booked=1).
|    - On conflict (slot already booked), shows a user-friendly error message and offers
|      a way to try again.
|
| Rationale:
| - This split design (frontend in book.php, backend in book_handler.php) ensures that:
|    - Sensitive operations (database writing, double-booking checks) are only performed server-side.
|    - The user experience is smooth: selecting slots is interactive, and feedback is immediate.
|    - The system remains secure, using session authentication and prepared statements.
|
| Security Note:
| - All booking actions are performed through server-side validation in book_handler.php.
| - Only authenticated patients can submit bookings.
